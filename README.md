# Cellula-Bulk-RNA-seq-Clustering-Clinical-Prediction-Engine
This project provides a modular engine for rapid clustering and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA + KMeans) of bulk RNA-seq data, with integrated clinical outcome prediction (Cox model, Kaplan-Meier curves).  The default demo uses the S100 protein family (e.g., S100A4/A8/A9/A11).
